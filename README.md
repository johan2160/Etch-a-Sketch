## Instructions

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   Follow our instructions on setting up your project’s GitHub repository.

2. **Creating a Webpage**:
   - Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
   - Use JavaScript to create the divs dynamically. Avoid manually copying and pasting them in your HTML file.
   - Place the grid squares inside a "container" div in your HTML file.
   - Utilize Flexbox to arrange the divs as a grid. Avoid CSS Grid for this project, as Flexbox is the focus.
   - Pay attention to borders and margins, as they can affect the size of the squares.

3. **Hover Effect**:
   - Implement a hover effect where the grid divs change color as the mouse passes over them, resembling a pixelated trail.
   - Set up event listeners for mouse enter and leave events to trigger the effect.
   - Explore different methods for changing the color of the divs, such as adding a new class or directly modifying the background color using JavaScript.

4. **Adding a Button**:
   - Add a button at the top of the screen to prompt the user for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
   - Upon user input, remove the existing grid and generate a new grid with the specified dimensions while maintaining the total space.
   - Limit the user input to a maximum of 100 squares to prevent potential performance issues.
   - Research button tags in HTML and how to execute JavaScript functions on click events.
   - Utilize prompts for user input.

5. **GitHub Push**:
   Push your completed project to GitHub!

## Extra Credit

Transform the behavior of squares when interacting with the mouse by introducing modifications:

1. **Randomized RGB Values**:
   - Instead of squares having uniform color, randomize their RGB values with each interaction.

2. **Progressive Darkening Effect**:
   - Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%.
   - Aim for achieving a completely black square after ten interactions.
   - Utilize the opacity CSS property for this effect.

You can choose to tackle either one or both of these challenges for extra credit. Good luck!
